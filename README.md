We decided to use FastApi as one of the fastest and useful framework. As ORM we
used a new library called SQL models. It contains sqlalchemy and pydantic model
in one model.

With this service you can:

- get vendor info by id
- get all vendors
- get product info by id
- get all products
- get products by color

This server has API specification (check another Wiki page
called [Vendor API](https://github.com/KochankovID/TonalCreamAssistant/wiki/Vendor-API))
