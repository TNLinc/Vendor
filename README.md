# Vendor service
We decided to use FastApi as one of the fastest and useful framework. As ORM we used a new library called SQL models. It contains sqlalchemy and pydantic model in one model.

With this service you can:
* get vendor info by id
* get all vendors
* get product info by id
* get all products
* get products by color

This server has API specification (check another Wiki page called [Vendor API](https://github.com/KochankovID/TonalCreamAssistant/wiki/Vendor-API))
